## Running the Microscope:
Double click the application icon (it should be of type "Application", not folder or dll or anything else).
	- If you get a security popup, try bypassing it:
		- On Mac, right-click the application and choose Open.
		- On Windows, there's usually a More Info button near the bottom of the popup that allows you to "Run Anyway."

Double-click application to open:

If the application doesn't launch at all, try disabling your Antivirus software (Avast, Norton, etc).

## Built-in and Custom Slide Loading
### Built-in Slides:
The OER Microscope HD comes pre-loaded with nearly 100 slides, each with different magnifications.

The slides are organized by course (BIO 101, BIO 132, etc).

If you're looking for a specific specimen, try clicking All Slides, then using the search bar to type in your specimen:

All Slides > Search Bar:

Click on any slide to load it.

Once a slide is loaded, the large up/down arrows act as Coarse Adjustment.
The small up/down arrows are Fine Adjustment.
The left and right arrows are the Mechanical Stage Control, either X or Y axis.
Clicking the Lens will rotate Objective Lenses from 4x to 40x (some specimens have 100x).

These controls can be found in the Options menu (top-left) > Highlight Help:

### Custom Slides:
The OER Microscope HD supports custom slides.  Here's a video describing how to prepare and load a folder of images:

Preparing a folder of slides for distribution can be tricky.  We used an iPhone attachment to capture all of the HD photos found in the program.

If you have the images, you should: 
0. Get them onto a computer.
1. Place them all in a folder.
2. Place the folder somewhere you can find it (ex. Documents or Desktop).
3. Make sure they're named alphabetically in the order you want them to be loaded.
	- ex. A folder with the following images in it: acidFast4.jpg, acidFast10.jpg, acidFast40.jpg.
	- When this folder is loaded, acidFast4 will be the first image (Objective Lens 4x).
4. Click Load Specimen Folder and navigate to the prepared slide folder on your computer.

Example folder with slide images:

Important things to note about custom slides:

1. Each folder should be one specimen.
2. The specimen folder needs to be on the same computer as the Microscope Application.
	- The app does not support loading slides from The Cloud, Blackboard, Drive, etc.
3. The specimen folder needs to be UNZIPPED.
	- If you are distributing a folder of images to students, it will probably get zipped when they download it.  The folder needs to be completely unzipped in order to work with the Microscope.
